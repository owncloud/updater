[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-AGPL--3.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE) [![ownCloud OSPO](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSPO-ownCloud-blue)](https://kiteworks.com/opensource) [![Docker Hub](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/owncloud)](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server)

The Updater provides a web-based interface for upgrading ownCloud Server installations to newer versions. It handles the complete upgrade workflow -- creating backups of the current installation, extracting the update package, and safely replacing the existing files while preserving configuration, themes and data directories.

## Part of Classic (OC10)

The Updater is a core component of the [ownCloud Server (OC10)](https://github.com/owncloud/core) upgrade process. It automates the manual steps of updating an ownCloud installation through a guided web interface.

The ownCloud Server is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/owncloud/server).

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and use the ownCloud updater.

### How It Works

1. Creates a backup directory under the ownCloud data directory
2. Extracts the update package content into `backup/packageVersion`
3. Copies the current instance (except data dir) to `backup/currentVersion-randomstring`
4. Moves all folders except `data`, `config` and `themes` from the current instance to `backup/tmp`
5. Moves all folders from `backup/packageVersion` to the current version

### Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:owncloud/updater.git
cd updater
make
```

### Running Tests

```bash
make test-php-unit         # Run PHP unit tests
make test-php-style        # Check code style
```

- **Rebase Early, Rebase Often!** We use a rebase workflow. Always rebase on the target branch before submitting a PR.
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates are managed via Dependabot. Review and merge dependency PRs promptly.
- **Signed Commits**: All commits **must** be PGP/GPG signed. See [GitHub's signing guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification).
- **DCO Sign-off**: Every commit must carry a `Signed-off-by` line:
  ```
  git commit -s -S -m "your commit message"
  ```
- **GitHub Actions Policy**: Workflows may only use actions that are (a) owned by `owncloud`, (b) created by GitHub (`actions/*`), or (c) verified in the GitHub Marketplace.

## About the ownCloud OSPO

The [Kiteworks Open Source Program Office](https://kiteworks.com/opensource), operating under
the [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com) brand, launched on May 5, 2026, to steward the open source
ecosystem around ownCloud's products. The OSPO ensures transparent governance, license compliance,
community health, and sustainable collaboration between the open source community and
[Kiteworks](https://www.kiteworks.com), which acquired ownCloud in 2023.

### License Migration to Apache 2.0

The OSPO is driving a strategic relicensing of ownCloud repositories toward the
[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), following
the [Apache Software Foundation's third-party license policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).

Individual repositories will migrate as their audit is completed. The LICENSE file
in each repo reflects its **current** license status (not the target).

**Current license: AGPL-3.0** (Category X per Apache policy -- cannot be included in Apache-2.0 works).

Migration prerequisites for this repository:

- **CLA/DCO coverage**: All past contributors must have signed agreements permitting relicensing
- **Copyleft dependency audit**: All AGPL/GPL dependencies must be replaced or isolated
- **KDE heritage review**: Any code with KDE-era copyrights requires legal analysis
- **Complete relicensing**: AGPL-3.0 is a strong copyleft license; migration requires full relicensing of all files, not just a header change
